LineUp is a web application for music festivals. The user will be able to browse through the festival lineup, the upcoming concerts and performers, filter them based on parameters like genre or the stage they will be playing at. Logged in users will be able to save concerts for later which they can see in a single list afterwards. Depending on the complexity of the project we might extend it with a calendar view, a notification system for upcoming concerts or a basic admin panel for content management.
